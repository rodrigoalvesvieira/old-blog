  <p id="indroduction"><span class="drops">I</span> am a hacker, an open source enthusiast and a computer science student at UFPE. I was born in 1994 in Recife, Brazil.<p>

  <p>I've been programming since 2009 mainly in ruby and javascript and, more recently, I'm a java and c++ developer too.</p>

  <p>Before college, I worked as the first intern of a startup called <a href="http://eventick.com.br/" target="_blank" title="Eventick">Eventick</a>.</p>

  <p>I speak Portuguese, English and I'm learning German.</p>

  <p>My areas of interest are Algorithms and Software Engineering. I want to learn and work in these fields in college and then work with them in the industry.</p>
