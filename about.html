  <p>I love working for startups, being part of the conception of business model and implementation of features and learning through the validation process.<p>

  <p>I am an Open Source software enthusiast and - when I can - I contribute a little bit to a project, or <a href="/projects" title="Projects by Rodrigo Alves Vieira">create my own</a>. <a href="https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira" title="Rodrigo Alves Vieira's GitHub profile">my GitHub</a> records everything.</p>

  <p>I rarely use IM, so if you want to get in touch with me be a little more old-school and send an email to rodrigovieira1994 [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>
