  <h1 id="intro">About</h1>

  <p><span class="drops">I</span> was born in 1994 in Recife, Brazil. I am a programmer working for small businesses.</p>

  <p>I am interested in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Unix, Lisp and Clojure.</p>

  <p>I am a Computer Science student at <a href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br/" title="CIn/UFPE">CIn/UFPE</a>.<p>

  <p>My other major interests are Entrepreneurship, Business Development and Management.</p>

  <p>I am an Open Source software enthusiast and - when I can - I contribute a little bit to a project, or <a href="/projects" title="Projects by Rodrigo Alves Vieira">create my own</a>. <a href="https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira" title="Rodrigo Alves Vieira's GitHub profile">my GitHub</a> records everything.</p>

  <p>I hang out on IRC (freenode), where my nickname is <b>rodrigovieira</b>. My favorite channels are <i>#clojure</i>, <i>#node.js</i>, <i>#rubyonrails</i> and <i>#rails-contrib</i>.</p>

  <p>I rarely use IM, so if you want to get in touch with me be a little more old-school and send an email to rodrigovieira1994 [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>

  <p>You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/rodrigoavie" title="Rodrigo Alves Vieira on Twitter">Twitter</a> and, of course, subscribe to <a href="/atom.xml">this blog's feed.</a></p>
