  <p id="indroduction"><span class="drops">I</span> am a hacker, an Open Source <a href="https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira" title="Rodrigo Alves Vieira's GitHub profile">enthusiast</a> and a Computer Science student at CIn/UFPE. I was born in 1994 in Recife, Brazil.<p>

  <p>I've been programming since 2009 mainly in Ruby and JavaScript and, since late 2012, I'm a Java developer too.</p>

  <p>I'm enthusiastic about Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, mostly. I plan to study and perform research in these fields in college and then work with them in the industry.</p>

  <p>Before college, I worked as the first employee of a Brazilian startup called <a href="http://eventick.com.br/" target="_blank" title="Eventick">Eventick</a>.</p>
