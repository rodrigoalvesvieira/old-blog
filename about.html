  <p><span class="drops">I</span> am a programmer working for small businesses in Brazil. My major interests are Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Unix, Lisp and Clojure.</p>

  <p>I am also strongly interested in Entrepreneurship, Business Development and Management.</p>

  <p>My full name is Rodrigo Alves Vieira and I was born in 1994, in Recife, Brazil.</p>

  <p>I am a Computer Science student at <a href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br/" title="CIn/UFPE">CIn/UFPE</a>.<p>

  <p>I love working for startups, being part of the conception of a business model, implementation of features, study of user feedback and everything related to the process of starting and validating a business.<p>

  <p>I am an Open Source software enthusiast and - when I can - I contribute a little bit to a project, or <a href="/projects" title="Projects by Rodrigo Alves Vieira">create my own</a>. <a href="https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira" title="Rodrigo Alves Vieira's GitHub profile">my GitHub</a> records everything.</p>

  <p>I rarely use IM, so if you want to get in touch with me be a little more old-school and send an email to rodrigovieira1994 [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>

  <p>You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/rodrigoavie" title="Rodrigo Alves Vieira on Twitter">Twitter</a> and, of course, subscribe to <a href="/atom.xml">this blog's feed.</a></p>
