  <p><span class="drops">I</span> am the Co-founder and CTO for <a href="http://brechoh.com.br" title="Brechoh">
Brechoh</a>, a very young Brazilian online marketplace which is currently focusing in a segmented user base: women selling women-stuff.</p>

  <p>I am strongly interested in Entrepreneurship, Business Development and Management.</p>

	<p>Technically speaking, my major interests are Software Craftsmanship, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Unix, Lisp and Clojure.</p>

  <p>I am also interested in Web Design, Information Architecture, UX and basically any field related to human-computer interaction.</p>

  <p>My full name is Rodrigo Alves Vieira and I was born in 1994, in Recife, Brazil.</p>

  <p>I am a Computer Science student at <a href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br/" title="CIn/UFPE">CIn/UFPE</a>.<p>

  <p>I love working for startups, being part of the conception of a business model, implementation of features, study of user feedback and everything related to the process of starting and validating a business.<p>

  <p>I am an Open Source software enthusiast and - when I can - I contribute a little bit to a project, or <a href="/projects" title="Projects by Rodrigo Alves Vieira">create my own</a>. <a href="https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira" title="Rodrigo Alves Vieira's GitHub profile">My GitHub</a> records everything.</p>

  <p>I rarely use IM, so if you want to get in touch with me be a little more old-school and send an email to rodrigovieira1994 [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>

  <p>You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/rodrigoavie" title="Rodrigo Alves Vieira on Twitter">Twitter</a> and, of course, subscribe to <a href="/atom.xml">this blog's feed.</a></p>
