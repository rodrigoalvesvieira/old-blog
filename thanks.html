  <h1 id="intro">Thanks</h1>

  <p><span class="drops">T</span>hroughout my life, there have been awesome people who help me sometimes (and help me to this day) and totally make a difference in my life. Even if this page is never read by anyone, I want to explicitly name the people I love most and am more grateful to in my life. I ought to list them here in order of importance to give them some acknowledgment.</p>

  <h2>Mom</h2>
  <p>My mom is undoubtedly the best people in the world for me. She raised me as best as one can be raised. I am afraid I will never be actually able to retribute what she has done for me.</p>

  <h2>Uncle Dé</h2>
  <p>Unclé Dé made me like studying and finding stuff out. I am glad as a child I had the opportunity to be close to such an enlightened person. I actually wish he was my father so we could have spent more time together.</p>

  <p>I haven't really missed anybody in this list.</p>

  <p>To everyone listed above: thank you for existing and being such an awesome person, you definitely made/make my life better.</p>
