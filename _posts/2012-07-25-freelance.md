title: Going Freelance
---

<span class="drops">I</span>'m going to work as a freelancer programmer now, I took this decision about a month ago and rapidly asked my boss to dismiss me, here I separate what caused me the decision in sections:

## Context, Time & Stress

I live in the metropolitan area of Recife, the 9th larger city in Brazil. It takes me 30 kilometers to go to work and back home everyday. Plus, I use public transportation in rush time so I often stand on the bus throught the whole trip, and the whole trip takes me from 3 to 3.5 hours per day.

I've spent the last few months thinking and planning about moving to Recife, closer to the office but then I realized it would create more problems to me, rather than diminishing them.

All this process of going to work and coming back is very stressful and I want to minimize it as much as possible.

## College

In a few months I'll be starting my Computer Science graduation at CIn/UFPE <a href="#foot-link-1">[1]</a> and - from now on - I'm reservating some time daily to prepate myself to it. I want to know very well at least basic stuff I'll face in the first disciplines.

When I joined the last company I thought I could work there and study in the same day, but then I realized that this wouldn't be possible. I can **either** work full time **or** study plainly.

## My projects

I'll also have more time to focus on personal projects, including open source ones and other projects that may - eventually - become a product and earn me money. And more time to read my books, too.

After all, I hope I'll ocasionally be able to take a day off and enjoy my time better.
