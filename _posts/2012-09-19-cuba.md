Cuba eliminated poverty and everybody knows that, right? What most people don't know is **how** they did it. Here is why:

* Poverty is a consequence of social economical inequality;
* There is no poverty if all the people are economically equal;
* So if everybody is poor, there is no inequality;
* Well, **there is no poverty if everybody is poor**

Great job Castro, great job.
