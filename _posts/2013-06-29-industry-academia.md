title: From Industry to Academia, the tale of a young developer
---

<span class="drops">B</span>ack in middle of 2010 - at 16 - I was a senior in High School and had been programming for the past couple years, for fun. I already found it all amazing, had been a member of the local Python community and really want to get deeper into Software development. Then in July I got offered my first job as a software developer intern at a local startup to build a new product for them.

I wasn't much of a programmer back then and wasn't sure if I should take the job, but I did. The experience was amazing, working in a company to deliver a real thing. Unfortunately the project did not get finished nor delivered and I dropped out in 3 months. But I had learned a few things and earned my own little money. It was enough to make me sure Software was **the** thing for me.

Then for the next couple years I worked at a consulting firm, then at a startup. Hacked in many projects, learned to use and master tools, delivered stuff. Everything is amazing when you're starting, even when the job at the consulting firm got boring as hell, I managed to work it out. And a year ago, I even started my [own] - now failed - startup with my friends.

## Going to Academia

I quit my normal job last year before starting college. I knew Computer Science might be very hard, my friends told me that, and I wouldn't be able to continue working for fair amount of time - my friends were right. Unfortunately I didn't take college as seriously as I should and, in one of the best CS schools in Brazil, it means you end up [failing] some disciplines.

But then I started dedicating myself more and I really enjoy college. UFPE is an amazing university and every day I find myself surrounded by many the brightest people I've ever met. Although I work my <strike>ass</strike> head off every day.

I got into a research project on [Mining Software Repositories] \(unfortunately, it can't be disclosed right now), under Professor Fernando Castor and I'm even working with doctorate candidates.

Another thing in particular that I'd like to point out is that (in my case at least) college forces me to learn much faster than my previous occupations did. And this can be good, sometimes I'm surprised that I'm learning so many things in so little time.

I believe that both the industry and academia are very competitive fields and they both allow you to be mediocre or brilliant, innovative. The two of them are hard to work with, and you can change the world in any of them, it's only about your dedication and the specific field(s) that you choose.

Both areas can be extremely demanding and, although they usually demand different things, you should be dedicate in both.

For years, I've seen people say that young developers shouldn't or didn't need to go to college. I wouldn't be so sure. It depends in a lot of things, your motivations, aspirations and inclinations, your short and long-term goals. It's really about **you** and so I guess no person can say to you what you should do. BUT - and this is a notable but - if you're in doubt, I think you should try college for some time to really know what you'll like to do.

Looking back in the mirror, I'm glad of what happened. The chance I had to get to know the industry before going to college gave me a good opportunity to know the field I was going to dedicate my life to and even prepared my for college, in some ways.

I definitely don't want to be an academic person, although I acknowledge the importance of academic research and education. I want to build and sell. Hope the future's got plenty of work for me.
