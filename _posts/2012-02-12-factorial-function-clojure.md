title: Non-recursive factorial function in Clojure
---

<span class="drops">O</span>n later 2011 I wrote a small article [1] on what I think is the most beautiful implementation of a factorial method in Ruby, in a non-recursive way. Recently, I did that in Clojure and the implementation also turned out to look very pretty to me. So here it is:

{% highlight clojure %}

(defn factorial [n]
  "Takes a number n, creates a list from the
  range of 1 upto n and multiplies the list items
  sequentially."
  (apply * (range 1 (+ n 1))))

(factorial 1) ;; 1

(factorial 4) ;; 24

(factorial 6) ;; 720

{% endhighlight %}

<br/>
Range Gotcha
------------

You may have noticed - and wondered why - that I define the range list using <span class="small_code">(range 1 (+ n 1))</span>, that´s because, in Clojure, the list generated by <span class="small_code">range</span> excludes the last number so if 4 was passed to the factorial function it would calculate <b>3 * 2</b> not <b>4 * 3 * 2</b> and thus it´d not get us the actual factorial of that number.

<div class="math">
n! = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
1 & \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
n* (n-1)! & \mbox{if } n > 0
\end{array} \right.
</div>
