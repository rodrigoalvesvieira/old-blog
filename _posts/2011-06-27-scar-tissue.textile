<span class="drops">S</span>car tissue that I wish you saw 
Sarcastic mister know it all 
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause 
With the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share 
This lonely view and
With the birds I'll share 
This lonely view and

Push me up against the wall 
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra 
Fallin' all over myself 
To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause 

With the birds (share) I'll share 
(this lonely) This lonely view and
With the birds (share) I'll share
(this lonely) This lonely view and
With the birds (share) I'll share 
(this lonely) This lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall 
A-Southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to ma and pa 'cause 
With the birds I'll share 

With the birds (share) I'll share 
(this lonely) This lonely view and
With the birds (share) I'll share
(this lonely) This lonely view and

Soft spoken with a broken jaw 
Step outside but not to brawl 
Autumn's sweet we call it fall 
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and
