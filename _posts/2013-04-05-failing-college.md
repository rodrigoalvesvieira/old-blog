title: Failing in College and what to do about it
---

<span class="drops">L</span>ast year I started college and even having some pretty good experiencing in programming, I have failed a lot.

The fact is, in college it is always more about Mathematics than programming itself and I did not know about that before and I took too much time to acknowledge this. So I successfully went thru Programming, Computing and Discrete Math. But failed both Calculus and Linear Algebra.

## The Problem with Failing and UFPE

There are actually many problems related to failing disciplines in a Computer Science education. First, it will weaken your self-esteem, or at least that was true for me. Real destroyer. It will delay your graduation, weaken your morale among fellow students and your professors. It will make it impossible to achieve a American/British/German university. Make it harder for you to be accepted in the departments study groups (A.I groups, Security groups, Software Engineering, Aug. reality) or be accepted in Research Projects.

Once you've failed, you've failed. Even when you get up to your feet again and pass those badass disciplines, you'll still be marked as a someone who failed. This quite frustrating and depressing.

## The problem with me

I've never studied really hard in high-school. In fact, thru all the years, I was just a mediocre student and I thought - and man, I wish I hadn't - that I could just get by without really studying.

Today I think: how could I behave like that and still want to be a Computer Scientist? Guess I was just really dumb!

Then I did the exam, and got admitted at the University.

## The overcome

As you might have guessed, I got really frustrated for having failed what I absolutely should not, and could not. Damn it man, it is my dream.

The only way to solve my problem is to really be a good student and do the exam again, get out of college and get in back again.  Start over and work really hard. I've decided I will do that.

## New to Computer Science? Here is my advice

If you are considering starting a CS graduation. Be careful. Try focusing much more on Math than in programming itself. Specially, study fields like Calculus, Analytic Geometry, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, Statistics and Algorithms. It will help you a lot.
