Help me run away from Google

<span class="drops">P</span>rivacy, spying and surveillance problems have recently raised (much more than ever before) in the world. I, as a Google user, am concerned with some of my important data being stored by them. But I use very few <a href="#foot-link-1">[1]</a> products of theirs (very very few, in comparison with the impressive number of their existent products) and these are:

1. GMail

Ok, pretty much everyone agrees that GMail is impressive. I even use it with a @gmail address, but I have domains and can easily afford a particular one, so that's not the problem. But GMail is insanely good at detecting spam, so I ask: if I'm going to have my own email server, what's the best thing to do to have spam detecting nearly as good as GMail's?

Actually, I'm not all that interested in switching off GMail right now, but I wanna know my options and where to go in case I change my mind.

2. Calendar

What's

3.
