title: I Went Surfing
---

<span class="drops">I</span>'ve been looking for a something to start as a hobbie. I love programming more than any other activity in my life but sometimes I get so immersed into  programming and spend so much time non-stop on it that I'm afraid I might as well get very bored someday and I definitely don't want it to happen.

Well, I've found this hobbie and it is Surf. I love beaches, sun and I had never practiced any radical sport. I must admit that Surf has always seemed awesome to me. Also, I realized I live in one of the more appropriate states in Brazil for surf. With this great opportunity and excitement, I went surfing:

Hopefully, I'll also gain from the many benefits of surfing (2). These all might help me compensate the time I spend sat in front of the Computer everyday.

It all seemed quite hard to get started, but I'm sure it will get easier and easier as I practice the sport. Right now I am tired to death but eager to enter the seas again.
