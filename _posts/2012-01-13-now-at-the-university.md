title: Now at the University
---

<span class="drops">I</span>'ve been programming for almost 3 years now. Until now, it was all about "autodidactism", as I never participated in any course related to programming. Actually, no course at all.

h2. TL;DR 

This is not a technical post. 

I've been working professionally for one year and a half now, and sometimes I feel the lack of formal education. My coworkers notice that too, and gently report to me.

I recently submitted to a selection process of a Brazilian Federal University [UFPE] for their *Computer Science* program/course, for the second time. In Brazil, the best Universities are usually the state ones. Well, this time I was approved! And I'm excited and anxious to begin! Seems like a great opportunity to learn the building blocks of Computing, among many Mathematical fields.

I must express my gratitude for [Atela], the company I work for for giving me full support while I was preparing myself to the tests. Especially my chief and coworker, [André Braga], who even let me stay totally away from work during the very week before the final tests, and at that time (November 2011) the company had several projects to deliver.

I think the University is going to help me. Filling my knowledge gaps, at least some of them. The classes for me only start on August, but I'm so eager for them already!
