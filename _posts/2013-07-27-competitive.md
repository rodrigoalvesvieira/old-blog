title: Competitive Programming - Getting Started
---

<span class="drops">C</span>ompetitive programming is something very worth doing in my opinion. The whole idea of spending time solving problems (ideally, complex ones) with a team, in a short amount of time is amazing.

The CS department (CIn/UFPE) where I study is one of the leading institutions in the Brazil-wide competitions and I realize that many (actually most of) the brightest minds in the department that I know are members of the department teams, and I obviously would like to be part of it.

To be honest, I'm not all that fond of the idea of competing with other teams for a prize. Instead, what is really appealing to me in all this is how much I can learn by working with these types of problems.

These programs offer a unique way of learning by doing and a great opportunity for developing your troubleshooting and problem solving skills, and I believe one can never be done with it.

So I started learning C++ in early this year and I'm enjoying it so far while ending my Introduction to Algorithms course.

To make me get going faster I bought a book called [Competitive Programming 3](https://sites.google.com/site/stevenhalim/), by two authors called Felix and Steven Halim and started doing some exercises from my favorite judge: [UVa](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/) and I am placing my solved problems in https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira/UVa

For the next 3 or 4 years my main goal is to learn as much Computer Science as my brain supports. I guess this will help me a lot, specially with my Algorithms and problem-solving skills.

By the end of the year I'll attempt to become a member of the department
