title: Startup Validation Questions
---

<span class="drops">I</span>t's a very tough to determine wheter a product/startup idea is feasible or really interesting or not. There are many ways to increase the chance of success and many ways to measure growth and market acceptance. But before all of these, I think one should consider asking oneselves some questios about one's idea. I've collected some questions in books and other blog posts and put them all here for future consulting:


* Is it something customers want?

* What problem are you solving?

* Can it be solved?

* Whose problem is it?

* Will they pay for it?

* How hard would it be for another company to copy you?

* Why are you able to produce and deliver it more than anybody else?

* How hard is it to acquire a customer?

* Are your customers coming back or attracting more customers?
