<span class="drops">I</span>'ve spent a great deal of time thinking that comments are a superfluous thing in a code base. I used to believe that any code can be succinct and well-written enough that it become obvious for any programmer to figure out what it does.

That is incorrect for the choice of documenting or not is not about aesthetics, it's about *communication*.

Any arguably large software will be developed for several months or even a couple years with changing teams. Not having the critical parts pragmatically documented by comments in the code may increase the chances of misunderstandings and misleading assumptions.

You *should not* deliberately document your code. Having tons of comments for the sake of having them is going to hurt you. Don't forget that once you add comments to your functions and classes, you should maintain it just like the code itself.

The following code is a good example of documentation done in a very straighforward way:

{% highlight ruby %}

    # This method is designed to perform select by a single column as direct SQL query
    # Returns Array with values of the specified column name
    # The values has same data type as column.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   Person.pluck(:id) # SELECT people.id FROM people
    #   Person.uniq.pluck(:role) # SELECT DISTINCT role FROM people
    #   Person.where(:confirmed => true).limit(5).pluck(:id)
    #
    def pluck(column_name)
      column_name = column_name.to_s
      klass.connection.select_all(select(column_name).arel).map! do |attributes|
        klass.type_cast_attribute(attributes.keys.first, klass.initialize_attributes(attributes))
      end
    end

{% endhighlight %}

In the example above ([extracted from ActiveRecord]) the comments are totally appropriate. They do not provide useless and duplicated information. In fact, they are essencial to the understanding of the code that it describes.

Conscious selection of what has to be documented and what need not to be is essential for your code base. Also, you should use automated tools with good markup options for generating documentation. There are many tools that do it well such as YUIDoc for JavaScript and RDoc for Ruby.

I believe that in special cases, documentation is as important as testing. The special cases are represented by some critical parts of our code base, such as calculation functions and vector graphic generators.

Many of the problems that occur to Software Development come from communication failure. Your code is probably never expressive enough. By using simple, straightforward comments to describe the behaviour of our code we can prevent bad stuff from happening as well as helping new developers grasp the functionality of the software better and making development easier and occasionally faster.
