title: Why to support programming user groups
---

<span class="drops">I</span>f you have a tech company or some other kind of company that depends much on hackers, then you certainly can benefit from supporting programming/development user groups.

There are a lot of reasons for it. You may be looking to hire people (and if you're really a tech company then you'll probably be doing it all the time), you may be selling products/services for hackers, like web hosting or some proprietary technology or even consulting, etc.

By supporting these user groups, your company may certainly grow its reputation among hackers, and it can only be a good thing.

So I even suggest, don't spend money with some non-technical recruiter and instead sponsor these groups and use this as your recruiting mechanism.

Also, doing this may be way less expensive than you may be thinking. Of course sponsoring huge events will be costly and may not be the best for your company, but there are always smaller, local user groups to with you can contribute and benefit from.

P.S: now this article could be extended from technical user groups to entrepreneurship meetings too. You can find good opportunities in those.
