<span class="drops">A</span>ll over the world we have these huge spaces like factories, construction sites, clubs, tech campuses and universities where people constantly need to move from a building to another and stuff like that.

I think there's a good opportunity there for the emergence of a company offering an inward (restricted area), private bicycle transportation service to solve transportation issues in these places.

## How would it work?

Imagine yourself as the administer of some university. Let's say  there are 10 thousand people everyday in campus, on average. Now you could ask for 2% the number of people in bicycle, just to begin with (later you could upgrade the number of bicycle, if needed).

There you have 200 bicycle, ready to be used and shared. Awesome, non-polluting, safe, healthy fuel-free transportation for everyone inside the university perimeter.

All bicycle and other equipment would not be purchased by the customer and owned by the startup. All things rented, and payment done in the good pay-as-you-go fashion.

How security would work for this idea I haven't thought much. But one way could be not only restricting the use within the perimeter of the place but also restricting to "verified" people.

Maybe the bicycle could be slightly customized with the subscribing company logo and color.

The monthly subscription would be calculated for every customer. Based on the number of bicycle, parking stations and other equipment requested. Of course any damage done to any of the equipment would mean additional cost for the customer.

Bicycle transportation is becoming more and more popular (not to mention cool) these days and this idea would make it way more practical for the possibly interested institutions to implement it.
