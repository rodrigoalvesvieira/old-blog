title: C and Java tips
---

<span class="drops">A</span>s college makes me get knee-deep into C and Java almost everyday now,
I see myself constantly discovering new stuff about both languages that make my life easier.

In this post I'm gonna write down my findings to this date which I think are worth sharing.

## C

### Tell the compiler the array size in advance in function parameters

Sometimes you have a function which performs some operation on an array that has a known minimum size.

So you can do:

{% highlight c %}
void tom(int myArr[static 10]);

//instead of 
void jerry(int myArr[10]);
 
*/

{% endhighlight %}

You told the compiler that the `tom` function receives an array that has at least ten integers.
By doing this you can give a hint to the compiler about optmizing your code and it'll promptly alert you if you try to call the function with anything but an array of at least 10 integers.

## Java

### Alternative notation for methods that receives a List of objects

You probably often write methods that receive a `List` of a given object type as a parameter. This is done when you gotta perform some operation on each element of a given set without knowing the number of elements within it.
The normal take is to write:

If you don't need to actually have this set as a `List` you can do:
