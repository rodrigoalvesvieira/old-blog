title: On VIM
---

<span class="drops">T</span>here is an active trend going on for quite some time about how awesome VIM is. That's great, people using whatever they want to get their code written.

The problem is I see a lot of people referring to their VIM skills as if it where something special. Well, it's not. Knowing VIM is like knowing Chess. I doesn't necessarily make you smarter, but it makes you better at it. In other words, a VIM user knows more about VIM than a non-user, but is not necessarily smarter than him.

By the way, I've used VIM for 2 years, after a few months with Emacs. I use Sublime Text 2 now.

Don't get me wrong, I intend no harm or flame war, it's just that I've been observing this pattern of a few people who think VIM means more than it means.

Knowing VIM only proofs that you know VIM, but hey, it's a good editor indeed. It'd hardly survive for such a long time otherwise.

And if you're more productive with VIM, there is no doubt you should keep on using it.
