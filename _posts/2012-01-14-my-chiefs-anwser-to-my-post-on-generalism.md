title: My Chief's Answer to My Post on Generalism
---

<span class="drops">Y</span>esterday I wrote a [post about Generalism on Software Development], that was a reply to an argument of my chief and coworker. I wrote the post, sent it to him and asked for his answer, and there it is, as promised:

<blockquote>
  There are differences between big and small companies. The kind of professional that, in this moment, we need everyone (say, people working on the company) to be is someone adaptable and open to deal with various kinds of technologies and techniques.
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we had structure (we, [Atela], are a startup), we'd hire a marketeer, a salesman, etc. But as we don't have, we struggle to fill - even slightly - this gap.
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Someone who, in small companies, works with the Web and don't know CSS, is fated to projects with serious delay and time loss, for he/she won't be able to change an alignment when necessary. Besides, it's a programming language (whether you like it or not), and has not to do with _Design_. HTML/CSS is the technical translation of the layout. Even another coworker of ours (a Computer **Engineer**) is studying HTML/CSS/JS. You'll still have to pass to many paradigms, get away from the (programming) languages and see many other concepts in order to become a [Computer Scientist], and this development is part of your internship. If we wanted someone who can only work with Ruby or only JavaScript, with no quality as a "snooper", generalist or proactive, we'd have other options than you.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  The good engineers learn calculations and science that they'll never use in their lives, because there is already software giving stuff for them, for free, but they can make it work without the existing software.
