title: Turning a file into an array of lines in Ruby
---

<span class="drops">G</span>etting lines of a file stored in an array might be something very useful. In Ruby you can do this with admirable ease with the basic<span class="small_code">IO</span> class:

<div class="code">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1521496.js?file=array_of_lines.rb"></script>
</div>

That's it. So simple and beautiful, yet powerful.
