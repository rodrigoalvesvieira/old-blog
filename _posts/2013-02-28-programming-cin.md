<span class="drops">I</span>'m a freshman Computer Science student at [CIn/UFPE], one of the main technological centers in Brazil and in this post I'll explain how Computer Programming is taught there and what are the benefits and drawbacks of their approach.

First, the program is composed by exams, exercise lists and finally, a project.

The program is pretty intensive for they assume the alum  ni have no previous experience in programming (which is a great assumption to make, of course).

They give preference to the Object Oriented paradigm and use Java. For me, there is no inherent problem here. I think it's preferable to teach programming with OO first (if you have to choose the paradigm) and I don't think Java is a bad choice (well, not anymore).

 And although Java is pretty syntactically fat (thus making it harder for remembering language instructions), I think this verbosity helps too, when you need to visualize how things are supposed to behave and what data is supposed to be represented, and where.

Some concepts are really well explained in the course: polymorphism, encapsulation, DRY principles, inheritance, modularity, project patterns and some basic principles for facilitating code maintenance and understanding between developers.

## The Exams

The exams require up to the latest subject given, so they only require what has been covered until the day of the exam. Everything okâ€¦but, here is the weird part: the exams are done with **pencil and paper**!

I still find this bizarre even after tons of explanations heard. The main rationale around this (from the professors) is that they need to make sure that the alumni are learning Java properly and that the user's code development is not facilitated by some tool/IDE like Eclipse, which apparently makes it really hard for someone to miss the language keywords.

Also, the exams are not hard. At all. That's what is wrong with this approach in my opinion. Programming is much more about learning how to solve problems with elegant and fast solutions than having all keywords from a language recorded in your mind.

## The Exercise Lists

During the first part of the program, three exercise lists are assigned, for helping us practice our programming skills. These lists are intentionally more advanced that the topics given, this is done in order to make students really search for solutions and interact to each other to figure out how to make things work.

## The Project

Now this is where the course really gets interesting. In the middle of discipline, they shift focus the the discipline project, which is to be developed by teams of two students.

They present us with a project (the class has around 50 members) and each team has to develop and deliver that project within a month, trying to make everything as smart and easy-to-understand-and-maintain as possible.

The project not only helps students really grasp the workings of Software Development but they also help us develop collaboration skills, which is great for any programmer.

## Wrapping up

I think the approach at CIn is fairly reasonable except for the written exams. And everything else is very realistic, stimulating and engaging.

So, what do you think of the approach at CIn/UFPE? How do they teach programming at your University?
