title: Unix Goodies \#1: cal
---

<span class="drops">T</span>his is the first post of a series called _"Unix Goodies"_. In this series I will write a ton of blog posts, each one about a specific Unix program that may save your life. This one is about <span class="small_code">cal</span>, the tiny calendar program, that seems to be quite unpopular.

It's built into every Unix box, so if you're using one, just fire up the terminal and run:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cal
</pre>

It displays the current month calendar. I've noticed a weird behavior: on Ubuntu it highlights the current day but on the Mac, it doesn't :(

You can also consult a specific month of a specific year by passing the month number - 10 for December, for example - and the year.

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cal 12 1994
</pre>

This is just the basic usage of the <span class="small_code">cal</span> utility. More can be found in it's manual page.
