title: My Setup
---

<span class="drops">T</span>here is this really nice site on the Internet called [The Setup] where great developers, designers and other artists go and write up the things they use to get their job done. People like [Paul Graham], [Derek Sivers], [Alex Payne], [Salvatore Sanfilippo] and [Jakob Nielsen] are already there.

As I'm not such a great/recognized professional as they are (not yet, muahaha) and so I wasn't - of course - invited to tell what I use there, so I decided I'd write here in my blog the things I use to get my job done.

## What Hardware Do I Use?

I have a 13" late-2011 MacBook Pro, I don't use mouse and I have no additional screen. I am very happy with only the Macbook and no more hardware on top of it.

I own a 8GB iPhone 4 and I love it, everyday I stare at it and say: what a piece of art!

Additionaly I have [Kindle Touch (no 3g)] and I love it. The Kindle is just awesome, yes it can be improved, but I don't plan on buying phisical books any longer only because of such a great reading experience I have with this device.

## And what software?

### Desktop software:

\* Google Chrome for browsing the web and inspecting my web applications;

\* Terminal.app where I spend a huge deal of my time, everyday;

\* For text editing I use [Textmate]  (I've been using Sublime Text 2 since the beginning of the year but switched back to Textmate when it was open-sourced), which I also love;

\* [iA Writer] for writing (including the articles on this blog and the READMEs of my projects);

\* Dropbox do sync everything;

\* Apple iCloud to sync what Dropbox doesn't sync;

\* I go with [Limechat] for IRC;

\* iTunes for my songs and podcasts;

\* Skype for talking with my coworkers

### Web-based software

\* GitHub 'cause it's awesome and there is no better way to collab with other developers;

\* Basecamp for keeping up with the team I mostly work with;

\* Heroku, where most of my Rails apps are running

### Software for creating software

\* Ruby, yeeeeah;

\* JavaScript, I want to really master the language so I'm trying to do as much as possible with it;

\* [Ember.js], the JavaScript MVC framework that better suits my needs;

\* [Postgres.app], this awesome app makes it easy to use PostgreSQL on the Mac. Seriously, no hassle.

\* [RubyMotion], because I'm now into iOS development and did not want to go deep into Objective-C;


## What would be my dream setup?

I think I'm pretty close to it already, I only want to own a 11" Macbook Air and benefit from its 2.38 pounds of awesomeness and enjoy running SSD instead of my current HD.
