title: Ruby Method Visibility Alternative Notation
---

<span class="drops">P</span>rogrammers have the recurrent necessity to control access to methods and variables in their code. In Ruby we generally do it all by declaring the keywords <span class="small_code">public</span>(not often, though), <span class="small_code">protected</span> and <span class="small_code">private</span> before method definitions. The file below illustrates what I'm talking about:

<div class="code">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1521323.js?file=greek_alphabet.rb"></script>
</div>

Here the second and third methods are made protected and the last two ones, private. The first method is public, we don't need to specify that because it's not preceded by any access declarator and defaults to public.

There is nothing wrong with the approach taken in the <span class="small_code">GreekAlphabet</span> class, however there is another notation for access declaration in Ruby that sometimes may be easier to read:

<div class="code">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1521323.js?file=greek_alphabet_1.rb"></script>
</div>

Notice that we did not pass the <span class="small_code">alpha</span> method to neither <span class="small_code">protected</span> nor <span class="small_code">private</span> and so it's public.

Maybe you prefer this second notation, too. See you in the next post!
