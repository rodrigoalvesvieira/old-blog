what i want to invest in

when I say invest, i mean invest time. since time is the only thing i have.

i want to dedicate myself to build something people want, more specifically, build something hackers want.

i am a hacker, i code everyday, i have work on a small but broad variety of applications and there are many, many things that can be improved in this area

one of the more important things, perhaps the single most important thing you need to develop a business, is know your customer.

also, they say the best products are the ones their founders create for themselves. and as a hacker, i am creating this for myself.
