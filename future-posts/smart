words on smart people

as a computer science undergraduate student at a good university in brazil, I'm always surreounded by incredibly smart people from math, computer science, engineering and other exact fields [1].

i like interacting wth them (I mean, listening to them) because i guess that if i can observe some pattern of how their minds work i might get some good insights and perhaps become smarter myself.

the thing that i observe in these people that i find mostly interesting in them is:

they know they do not need to prove anybody anything.

So they don't behave like they're gods and above everything. As I read once on the web: smart people are aware of how even theirselves are small in the great scheme of things.

[1] I'm not saying that only exact fields people are really smart. that is obviously false. oh by the way, what makes someone smart?

you could say that im generalizig

I know quite a few people that match the points I wrote here but I have a math professor who completely fits in. He's probably the smartest guy I've been close to and he is fucking great.
